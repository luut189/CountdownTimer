## Countdown Timer

This is a countdown timer 

## How to run

Just download the `.jar` file and **run**.

Probably need to run with **Terminal** though, so here is the commands for that:
```
java -jar CountdownTimer.jar
```
And you probably need `Java 17` to run.

## Config

You can head inside the `App.java` file and change the `inputDateTime` into your preferred **date** and **time** with this format `HH:mm:ss dd MM yyyy`

If you download the `.jar` file, **good luck**.
