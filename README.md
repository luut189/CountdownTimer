## Countdown Timer

This is a countdown timer 

## How to run

**Requirement**: `Java 17`

Just download the `.jar` file from [*Releases*](https://github.com/luut189/CountdownTimer/releases/tag/v1.0) and **run**.

You might need to run with **Terminal** though, so here is the commands for that:
```
java -jar CountdownTimer.jar
```

If you want to double-click to run the `.jar` file, you might need to do some [**StackOverflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/) on your own. Good luck!

## Config

You can head inside the `App.java` file and change the `inputDateTime` into your preferred **date** and **time** with this format `HH:mm:ss dd MM yyyy`

If you download the `.jar` file, **good luck**.
